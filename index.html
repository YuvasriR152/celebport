His maternal grandfather is a Dutch immigrant and his maternal grandmother is of Irish descent.On his paternal line he is of English, Scottish, and German ancestry.<br>He was brought up both in Melbourne and in the Outback in Bulman, Northern Territory. He has said, "My earliest memories were on the cattle stations up in the Outback, and then we moved back to Melbourne and then back out there and then back again. Certainly most of my childhood was in Melbourne but probably my most vivid memories were up the with crocodiles and buffalo. Very different walks of life.He attended high school at Heathmont College before his family again returned to the Northern Territory, and then moved a few years later to Phillip Island.</p>
